Description:-
    This is a addin for microsoft outlook. The name of the addin is "Mail manager"
    The addin provides the following features:-
                  >Whenever you send an email, a json file containing information about the mail is stored in your local device.
                  >Whenever you send an email, a copy of all the attachments are stored locally as well.

Extra features:-
    Some extra features are also provided in the form of mail modes and rule. There are 3 
    rules that your email must follow in order for the addin to approve it and send.
    The three rules are:-
                  >Attachments names cannot be suspicious (malware.txt,virus.js etc).
                  >Attachments cannot exceed 5mb.
                  >Attachments cannot contain confidential information (checks for keywords like "secret" or "confidential" in the txt files).

Mail modes:-
    These conditions might be too constricting for some users who might want to bypass them, 
    for example some users would not want their attachment names to be analysed or they might 
    want to send attachments larger than 5mb. So for these reasons users are provided with 3 
    mail modes (Private,Protected,Public) to bypass them.
